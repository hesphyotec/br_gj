# Sigil of Darkness - By Hesphyotec
### About
- Sigil of Darkness is my first completed video game project.
- It was made in a month as a submission for the 2025 Boss Rush Game Jam.
- All art is drawn by me, all programming is done by me, music is credited to Gigakoops Music.
### Gameplay
- The theme for the Boss Rush Game Jam was "Spin", resulting in the gameplay being inspired by Beyblade and Lego Ninjago.
- Sigil of Darkness is a boss rush game where you take on 3 bosses with unique attacks, mechanics, art, and music.
- All movement and combat is done through the mouse:
  - Hold RMB to charge momentum and release to fly towards your mouse pointer.
  - Hold LMB while moving in order to attack.
  - While charging, you gain a shield that can block 1 hit.
  - While attacking, if you collide with an enemy both you and the enemy will bounce off each other.
  - While charging, spin your mouse around the player to charge up a super-charged spin.
- After defeating each boss, the next boss is unlocked.
